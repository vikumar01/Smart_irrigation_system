# Smart_irrigation_system

Abstract—Agriculture has been the most important practice
and livelihood provider in many countries but the traditional
methods used are not much efficient as they result in a lot of water
wastage and formation of fungus due to over moisture in soil. This
paper proposes an effective and efficient automated irrigation
system using ESP32 micro-controller. The goal is to help farmers
in irrigating their land in a more convenient way. The system
includes programmed sensors such as soil moisture, humidity and
rain sensor which send data to ESP32 micro-controller. ESP32
transmits the data to AWS cloud using Message Queue Telemetry
Transport protocol where it is processed and result is sent back
to ESP32 notifying start/stop of the motor. The data gathered
by sensors can be viewed in Amazon Web Services (AWS) and
websites by users to keep a track. The system also includes
manual operation of motors in case of connectivity failure where
users can control the water pump through the website or direct
switch. In this way, a secure, conservative and automated system
is developed solving agricultural irrigation problems.
